  The main feature of MovieBook is publishing reviews for movies. It utilizes TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/) for the movie suggestion and displaying trending movies.

All of the movies provided on the website lead to a Movie Detail page created with params, where you can see the details of the specific movie.
